## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

I am most excited to learn about how AI can be used to do help peoples every day jobs. It is interesting to me because it can turn into something that while it will begin taking peoples jobs, it should in theory do their jobs quickly and perfectly. Im also excited to learn about the future of AI, and how it could become more advanced to have the ability to do things like think for itself, but still make sure we can control it so stuff like in the movies doesnt happen.
